 Toy Problems

This repository contains solutions for three week 1 toy problems code Challenge: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator. I used the problem to solve using JavaScript.

- Challenge 1 Student Grade Generator 
- Challenge 2 Speed Detector 
- Challenge 3 Net Salary Calculator 

## Challenge 1 Grade Generator

This function prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on the marks.

 A: Marks > 79
 B: 60 to 79
 C: 50 to 59
 D: 40 to 49
 E: Marks < 40

```javascript
function studentGradeGenerator(marks) {
    if (marks > 79) return 'A';
    if (marks >= 60) return 'B';
    if (marks >= 50) return 'C';
    if (marks >= 40) return 'D';
    return 'E';
}
This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines whether the speed is within the limit or if the driver should receive demerit points.

Speed Criteria
Speed <= 70: "Ok"
For every 5 km/s above 70: 1 demerit point
Points > 12: "License suspended"

This program calculates an individual’s net salary by taking into account the basic salary and benefits. It calculates the PAYE (Tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

- **NSSF Deductions**: Pension contributions based on the gross salary.
- **Net Salary**: The total salary after all deductions.

The gross salary is the sum of the basic salary and any benefits:

```javascript
